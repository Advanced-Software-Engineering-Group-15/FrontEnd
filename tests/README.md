# Testing with Jest

## Getting Started
Jest is a JavaScript framework used for testing. Jest is used in this repo to test .tsx files.

We use the pakage ts-jest instead of Babel7

Jest unit test files must be named after the component or utility function that they are testing and end in .test.js

To run all tests, type `npm` test in the commaned line or `jest`

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

[This course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-end-to-end-testing-with-jest/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd?autoAdvance=true&autoSkip=false&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2217001) covers TDD very well.

>Test Driven Development, TDD, is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed and tracking software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases, as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
